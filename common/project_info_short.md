# Projects in a Nutshell

This is a TL;DR for [our guide to projects](plan.md).

There are two main types of projects: **Centralized Projects** and **Decentralized Projects**.

**Centralized Projects** are big projects made to decide really important aspects of Qoryn Tiin as a community. Stuff like Major History, Geography, and Language.

**Decentralized Projects** are smaller projects, often managed by smaller groups of people. Stuff like the Town of Grickstallia, Knifebud plants, or individual characters.

Note that both **Centralized Projects** and **Decentralized Projects** can be approached with both **Gatherings** or **Independent Efforts**. However, **Centralized Projects** will (most times) be announced by **Prompts**, whereas **Decentralized Projects** generally will not. (You can read a short bit about Gatherings, Prompts, and Independent Efforts [here](prompt_info_short.md).)

Projects end in canonization, which is simply us writing down and filling stuff to make it official or "canon".
