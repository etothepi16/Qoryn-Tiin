Here is our plan for the building of Qoryn Tiin. Note: these
are not the objectives; this writing lays out *how* we will
complete the objectives.

## Centralized Projects

At times, we will need to make some large decisions about highly significant world aspects for Qoryn Tiin. At these times, a Centralized Project will be created. Centralized Projects will always be accompanied by Prompts.

These Centralized Projects will come with a deadline; you must submit your Showcases by the deadline.

World aspects such as Language, Basic Geography, or Magic System are examples of aspects that will require a Centralized Project.

## Decentralized Projects
Often there will be smaller world aspects that can be determined without the need of a community-wide organized effort. These are called Decentralized Projects and will likely not be preceded by a Prompt.

If you want to start a Decentralized Project, please ask the moderators before you start unless there is an announcement that says otherwise. Your idea may conflict with the canon or another project in progress. In the case of the latter, you may begin your Decentralized Project after you have gotten permission from the moderators. When it is deemed necessary, a post will be created to resolve the conflict, whether by vote or modification.

To start a Decentralized Project, you may either create a Gathering post (much like you would for a Centralized Project) or simply make an Independent Project.

Gathering posts for Decentralized Projects can be made at any time. When they are approved, you will receive your own channel for your team and anyone willing to contribute.

In the case of an Independent Project, all that is required (after you obtain permission) is that you create a Showcase when you have finished your project by yourself.

## Prompts

Every time we create a Centralized Project, we will post a Prompt to r/QorynTiin. Prompts will specify the aspect to be decided upon and the requirements/deadlines for nominations. An announcement will also be made on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/7bhGXGU) with a link to the Prompt posts.

More specifically, the Prompt will request Gatherings or Independent efforts.

## Gatherings

Gatherings are groups of people that work together on a single idea for a world aspect. For example, a Prompt is created to ask for people for ideas for the geography of Qoryn Tiin. Someone has an idea, so they create a Gathering to help them hash things out.

To create a Gathering, you make a post with the `Gathering` tag and whatever tags match the subject. In the case of the previous example, the `Geography` tag would be used.

Gatherings can also be created even when there is not a Centralized Project going. You can read more about this under "Decentralized Projects".

If the moderators deem the idea suitable and popular, your post will receive a link to a discord channel dedicated to your team and anyone willing to contribute. You are expected to organize the effort once the channel has been created.

## Independent Projects

Independent Projects are efforts by individuals to contribute to Qoryn Tiin. You may do an Independent Decentralized Project any time, but it is highly recommended that you contact the moderators first. Please also look over the canon to ensure that your idea does not conflict with it.

Once you have finished your Independent Project, you may create a Showcase. If your idea is approved, it will be accepted into the canon. If it isn't, don't worry! You can probably recycle some of the ideas from it for another idea.

Independent Centralized Projects are exactly like Independent Decentralized Projects, except that you must turn in your Showcase by the deadline specified by the Prompt post.

## Showcases

Showcases are posts that contain your polished ideas for your projects. This includes any artwork or other resources you think should be included. Go ahead, show off. Just make sure the Showcase clearly outlines your ideas.

## Polls

When two or more projects are in irreconcilable conflict or if we are deciding on a Centralized Project, a Reddit poll will be created. All are free to participate in this Poll. The Poll will give an outline of each Project involved, with links to their respective Showcases. From there, just vote on whatever project you like best! The most popular project wins.

## Integration

Once any Project (Independent or Gathering, Centralized or not), has been approved, a group of "Integrators" will begin the task of integrating that Project into the canon. The leader of the Project will likely be asked about specific details for the project.
