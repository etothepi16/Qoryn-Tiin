### So you wanna help develop Qoryn Tiin?

Great! We're happy to have you. Before you start worldbuilding, please familiarize yourself with our [WHATEVER THIS IS CALLED]. There are several

[CENTRALIZATION > LIKELIHOOD OF AFFECTING OTHER PROJECTS; MORE CENTRALIZED, MORE LIKELY; LESS CENTRALISED, LESS LIKELY]

Over time, Qoryn Tiin will host many different projects at varying scopes. There will be more centralized ones that have the potential to affect all of canon, and there will be less centralized ones that likely won't. More centralized topics include magic systems, global geography, and broad history. Less centralized topics include details of specific places, races, and languages, among others. Due to the differing nature of these topics, the submission process will vary depending on the level of centralization.

## Centralized Projects

For the biggest topics, the submission process will be led by moderators. This ensures organization, and allows for coordination between users. The process for centralized projects is detailed below.

1) Moderators will announce a project on the subreddit via a post with the [PROMPT] flair. This post will give the general topic, and will be closed off from discussion.

2) Users who have an idea for the project make posts on the subreddit. The post should summarize your idea, and should be flaired with both the [RECRUITMENT/GATHERING] flair and the green flair found on the prompt (e.g; if the prompt has the [MAGIC] flair, make sure your post also has the [MAGIC] flair). These posts will serve to gather collaborators who are interested in your suggestion.

3) Moderators will check all flaired posts to make sure they fit with existing canon. If everything checks out, they will comment and pin a link to a dedicated channel over on the Qoryn Tiin Discord for your idea. This channel will serve as a hub for discussing, refining, and polishing your submission.

*As an aside, don't hesitate to collaborate across ideas! If two groups have similar suggestions, consider combining them! The more teamwork we can get done, the better.*

4) At the submission date specified on the original prompt, moderators will ask [WHERE? DISCORD OR REDDIT?] for summaries of all currently proposed ideas. If everyone has come to an agreement on one proposal, that idea will be incorporated into canon by a team of integrators. Otherwise...

5) A poll will be held on Reddit between all remaining submissions. Users only allowed to vote once, so choose carefully! After [TWO?] days, the poll will close, and the winning submission will be integrated into canon.

**Note that you are [not?] allowed to (do it by yourself)**
