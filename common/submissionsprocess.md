# META - BEFORE THIS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED SOME DETAILS NEED TO BE IRONED OUT

**How long will Centralized polls be open?**

**How long will conflict resolution polls be open?**

# So you wanna help develop Qoryn Tiin?

Great! We're happy to have you. Before you start worldbuilding, please familiarize yourself with our guidelines for the process of submitting ideas. Note that this is a living document and that the rules may change as the Qoryn Tiin develops. If you have any questions, about the guidelines or anything else, feel free to contact a moderator on Reddit or Discord.

Over time, Qoryn Tiin will host many projects at different scopes. There will be more centralized ones that will have the potential to affect all of canon, and there will be less centralized ones that won't. More centralized topics include magic systems, global geography, and broad history. Less centralized topics include details of specific places, races, and languages, among others.

Due to the differing nature of these topics, the submission process will vary depending on the level of centralization.

## Centralized Projects

For the biggest topics, the submission process will be led by moderators. This ensures organization, and allows for coordination between users. The process for centralized projects is detailed below.

1) Moderators will announce a project on the subreddit via a post with the [PROMPT] flair. This post will give the general topic, and will be closed off from discussion.

2) If you have an idea for the project, make a post on the subreddit. The post should summarize your idea, and should be flaired with both the [RECRUITMENT/GATHERING] flair and any green flairs found on the prompt (e.g; if the prompt has the [MAGIC] flair, make sure your post also has the [MAGIC] flair). These posts will serve to gather collaborators who are interested in your suggestion.

3) Moderators will check all flaired posts to make sure they fit with existing canon. If everything checks out, they will comment and pin a link to a dedicated channel over on the Qoryn Tiin Discord for your idea. This channel will serve as a hub for discussing, refining, and polishing your submission.

*As an aside, don't hesitate to collaborate across ideas! If two groups have similar suggestions, consider combining them! The more teamwork before the final decision, the better.*

4) At the submission date specified on the original prompt, moderators will ask for 1-2 paragraph summaries of all currently proposed ideas. If everyone has come to an agreement on one proposal, that idea will be incorporated into canon by a team of integrators. Otherwise...

5) A poll will be held on Reddit between all remaining submissions. You are only allowed to vote once, so choose carefully! After [TWO?] days, the poll will close, and the winning submission will be integrated into canon. 

*If, shortly before the poll closes, there appears to be a tie, a moderator will cast a final vote before the poll closes.*

**Note that for centralized projects, individual submissions are allowed, but discouraged. If you would like to make an individual submission, contact a moderator with a summary of your idea when the Prompt is posted. They will contact you for your final summary by the submission date.**

## Decentralized Projects

Lower-level topics- the additions of a country, creature, facet of a magic system, etc.- will be user-led. Projects on this scale are generally small enough that any conflicts that come from their integration can be solved on a case-by-case basis. The process for decentralized projects is detailed below.

*These first few steps are if you are looking for collaborators. If you prefer to submit an idea on your own, still read through this, but pay special attention to the **Independent Projects** section below.*

1) If you have an idea for a project, make a post on the subreddit with the [Gathering] flair, as well any and all green flairs that are relevant to the submission ([HISTORY] and [CIVILIZATION] for a project about an old empire, for instance). Again, this post should have a summary of your core idea, and will work to get collaborators.

2) A moderator will review the post, and if the idea fits with existing canon, they will post a link to a Discord channel for your project.

3) Work! There are no deadlines for decentralized projects, and you are free to set whatever goals you wish (as long as it fits in with canon; check with mods if you're unsure). The aim should be to develop polished content that can be posted on Reddit, but whatever form that takes is up to you- lore posts, concept art, infographics, maps, short stories- all mediums are welcome.

4) Once a piece of work is finished, get in contact with moderators. They will review the proposed post to make sure it meshes with canon. If they give you the go ahead, make a post on r/QorynTiin! Your post should have the [SHOWCASE] flair, as well as any applicable green flairs. If your post is not primarily a written work (art, maps, etc.), please post a comment detailing the worldbuilding behind your submission.

5) Depending on the amount of positive engagement (comment activity, upvotes, etc.), moderators will decide whether or not to integrate your submission into canon. **Thus, if you see a showcase you really like, engage!** Upvote it, ask questions, say what you like about it, so that you increase the chances the post becomes canonized. If your post becomes canon, moderators will make a comment under your post saying so.

6) After you finish your work, you may choose to continue the project, focusing on finer details or exploring it from a different angle. If you choose to do this, it is expected that you will work towards another piece of polished content to post on the subreddit. Alternatively, you may choose to stop the project and disband your group of collaborators. If this is the case, contact a moderator on Discord or Reddit, and your Discord channel will be removed.

## Independent Projects

In some situations, you may not want collaborators, for impracticality or whatever other reason. If this is the case, please take into account the following guidelines.

* You do not need to make a recruitment post. Still, moderators will need to make sure your ideas fit in with canon before you begin working. Message one and they'll get back to you.

* On your showcase post, please add the [INDEPENDENT] flair.

* All other above guidelines follow.

## Conflict Resolution

Occasionally, while developing projects in teams, groups will disagree over the best path forward. **While we *strongly* encourage these conflicts to be resolved through discussion,** we understand that sometimes compromise isn't possible. In these cases, a poll will be held on the subreddit to choose between the competing ideas, following the guidelines below.

1) Write up a brief summary of your project, as well as summaries of all the conflicting ideas.

2) Contact a moderator to let them know that your project has conflicting ideas that need to be polled, including the written summaries of your project and proposals. The moderator will review your request, ruling out any ideas that conflict with canon. If there is still more than one option, they will approve your request to poll.

3) Revise and polish your summaries. Keep in mind you are writing these summaries for a general audience, and that the people voting may not have all the information on the project you do. Keep summaries concise and relevant, two paragraphs or less.

4) Contact a moderator (preferably the same one from earlier) and give them your revised summaries. They will set up a poll for other users to vote on their favorite idea. This poll will close after [HOW LONG? my vote is one day]. 

*Again, if the poll is about to end and there is a tie, a moderator will cast a vote to break it.*

5) Continue your project, using the winning idea to guide your work.

***Resolving conflicts via polling is considered a nuclear option. Only ask for a poll if you're positive there is no way to compromise between your ideas.***

## Revision

There may be times where a group or individual developing a project wishes to change it after their Showcase and integration. If this is the case, contact a moderator. These issues will be handled on a case-by-case basis, and may involve simply updating canon or a second poll, depending on the size of the revision.

## Sportsmanship

We understand that people work very hard on their submissions, and that it can hurt to see your project rejected. We encourage you to keep in mind that Qoryn Tiin is meant to be a fun activity for everyone involved, and would like to present some guidelines for good conduct.

1) **Respect ideas (and the people behind them).** Even ideas you disagree with, even ideas you don't think would fit. Everyone is working hard to present their submissions, so stay respectful. Don't harass people, don't use slurs, all that stuff. *On both Reddit and Discord, critique is welcomed, but keep it constructive!* Focus on how things can improve, rather than just how things are wrong.

2) **Don't take it personal.** At the end of the day, some submissions are going to be approved, and some aren't. This means nothing about you as a person, and shouldn't discourage you from working on other projects in the future! If your submission is voted down, please try to take it with grace.

3) Likewise, **don't be a sore winner**. If the community chooses your idea in a poll, remain respectful to the losing submissions.

## Final Notes

* Generally, users are free to join and leave teams at any time. If you missed the window of the original Gathering post, you are still allowed to work on the project, given people in the team are okay with it.

* Qoryn Tiin's Discord server acts as a place for discussion. No decisions on canonization will be made on Discord. In addition, any major posts on Reddit (Polls, Prompts, etc) will be announced on Discord as well.
