# So you wanna help develop Qoryn Tiin?

Great! We're happy to have you. Before you start worldbuilding, please familiarize yourself with our [WHATEVER THIS IS CALLED]. There are several 

whatever i don't have the patience now to write all hospitable

[CENTRALIZATION > LIKELIHOOD OF AFFECTING OTHER PROJECTS; MORE CENTRALIZED, MORE LIKELY; LESS CENTRALISED, LESS LIKELY]

Over time, Qoryn Tiin will host many different projects at varying scopes. There will be more centralized ones that have the potential to affect all of canon, and there will be less centralized ones that likely won't. More centralized topics include magic systems, global geography, and broad history. Less centralized topics include details of specific places, races, and languages, among others. Due to the differing nature of these topics, the submission process will vary depending on the level of centralization.

## Centralized Projects

For the biggest topics, the submission process will be led by moderators. This ensures organization, and allows for coordination between users. The process for centralized projects is detailed below.

1) Moderators will announce a project on the subreddit via a post with the [PROMPT] flair. This post will give the general topic, and will be closed off from discussion.

2) If you have an idea for the project, make a post on the subreddit. The post should summarize your idea, and should be flaired with both the [RECRUITMENT/GATHERING] flair and the green flair found on the prompt (e.g; if the prompt has the [MAGIC] flair, make sure your post also has the [MAGIC] flair). These posts will serve to gather collaborators who are interested in your suggestion.

3) Moderators will check all flaired posts to make sure they fit with existing canon. If everything checks out, they will comment and pin a link to a dedicated channel over on the Qoryn Tiin Discord for your idea. This channel will serve as a hub for discussing, refining, and polishing your submission.

*As an aside, don't hesitate to collaborate across ideas! If two groups have similar suggestions, consider combining them! The more teamwork before the final decision, the better.*

4) At the submission date specified on the original prompt, moderators will ask [WHERE? DISCORD OR REDDIT?] for summaries of all currently proposed ideas. If everyone has come to an agreement on one proposal, that idea will be incorporated into canon by a team of integrators. Otherwise...

5) A poll will be held on Reddit between all remaining submissions. You are only allowed to vote once, so choose carefully! After [TWO?] days, the poll will close, and the winning submission will be integrated into canon.

**Note that you are [not?] allowed to (do it by yourself)**

## Decentralized Projects

Lower-level topics- the addition of a country, creature, facet of a magic system, etc.- will be user-led. Projects on this scale are generally small enough that any conflicts that come from their integration can be solved on a case-by-case basis. The process for decentralized projects is detailed below.

*These first few steps are if you are looking for collaborators. If you prefer to submit an idea on your own, still read through this, but pay special attention to the **Independent Projects** section down there.*

1) If you have an idea for a project, make a post on the subreddit with the [RECRUITMENT/GATHERING] flair, as well as many green flairs that are relevant to the submission ([HISTORY] and [CIVILIZATION] for a project about an old empire, for instance). Again, this post should have a summary of your core idea, and will work to get collaborators.

2) A moderator will review the post, and if the idea fits with existing canon, they will post a link to a Discord channel for your project.

3) Work! There are no deadlines for decentralized projects, and users are free to set whatever goals they wish (as long as it fits in with canon; check with mods if you're unsure). The aim should be to develop polished content that can be posted on Reddit, but whatever form that takes is up to the user- lore posts, concept art, infographics, maps, short stories, all mediums are welcome.

4) Once a piece of work is finished, get in contact with moderators. They will review the proposed post to make sure it meshes with canon. If they give you the go ahead, make a post on r/QorynTiin! Your post should have the [SHOWCASE] flair, as well as any applicable green flairs. If your post is not primarily a written work, please post a comment detailing the worldbuilding behind your submission.

5) Depending on the amount of engagement (comment activity, upvotes, etc.), moderators will decide whether or not to integrate your submission into canon. **Thus, if you see a showcase you really like, engage!** Upvote it, ask questions, give comments, so that you increase the chances the post becomes canonized. If you post becomes canon, moderators will notify you via [WHERE?]

6) After you finish your work, you may choose to continue the project, focusing on finer details or a different aspect of the topic entirely. If you choose to do this, it is expected that you will work towards another piece of polished content to post on the subreddit. Alternatively, you may choose to stop the project and disband your group of collaborators. If this is the case, contact a moderator on [WHERE?], and your Discord channel will be removed.

### Independent Projects

In some situations, you may not want collaborators, for impracticality or whatever other reason. If this is the case, please take into account the following guidelines.

* You do not need to make a recruitment post. Still, moderators will need to make sure your ideas fit in with canon before you begin working. Message one on [WHERE?], and they'll get back to you.

* On your showcase post, please add the [INDEPENDENT] flair.

* All other above guidelines follow.
