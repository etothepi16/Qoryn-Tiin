# Creation Process in a Nutshell

This is a TL;DR for [our full guide to the world creation process](plan.md).

The Qoryn Tiin Worldbuilding Effort is powered by a process of idea generation. There are projects that will be started (more about those [here](project_info_short.md)) to guide the community in the making of the world. If these projects return good, popular results, they will be implemented into the **Canon**.

The **Canon** is a collection of all accepted writings, artwork, and other resources that define the world of Qoryn Tiin. It's the home of "official" Qoryn Tiin information.

A project will be judged by the **Showcase** it produces. For a project to be implemented into the **Canon**, it must be popular and fit with the current **Canon**. If the project conflicts with any other projects, the moderators will find a way to resolve that conflict.
