# Prompts in a Nutshell

This is the TL;DR for [our guide to prompts](plan.md).

A **Prompt** is a message that will notify people of a world aspect that needs to be decided upon. It will say 1) what your ideas should contain and 2) when, how, and where those ideas should be displayed.

A **Gathering** is a message that *you* make when you have an idea that you want to collaborate on. This is often a reply to a **Prompt**.

An **Independent Effort** is a thing you do by yourself, alone. Don't like collab? Flesh out your idea yourself.

A **Showcase** is a thing that you make (often a Reddit post) when you are done figuring out a world aspect. It shows the work you've done (writings, concept art, maps, etc.) so that others can clearly see and decide on your idea.

So to tie everything together, a **Prompt** gets made and people make **Gatherings** or do **Independent Efforts**. Before the deadline, they turn in **Showcases** to show off what they've done. Then it will be decided how to implement those ideas into the canon!
