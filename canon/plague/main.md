# The Haven Parasite

## History

>A plague known as the “Haven” parasite dates back to the first recordings of history.

In the past, the Haven parasite broke out many times. However,

>due to centralization and advancement in technology the parasite slowly disappeared and was declared to be eradicated.

This parasite was created by a figure from the past:

>a Qoryntinian created this with the intent to eliminate his enemies. However, it backfired and killed him too

This is unknown to most in Qoryn Tiin, as it is said that

>[the Haven parasite] was a plague of unknown origin

## Symptoms

The Haven parasite had several identifying symptoms, most notably that it

>infected hosts and drained their bodies of magical energy.

The parasite also affected the minds of its victims:

>They would lose conscious thought and would be at the whims of the parasite.

Visible symptoms were also included:

>The hosts would start to become unrecognizable as the greedy parasite drained their magic, causing their bodies to contort in order to live.

>The hosts would glow.

>the bone structure, organs, and tissue of the host change to suit the parasites’ will.

## Reproduction

>After attaching to the host it would begin draining energy for its survival and would replicate itself, killing the host. The new parasite continues on, searching for a new victim.

After some spreading and basic reproduction, it

>create[s] a new organ to make more parasites, making a strange growth on the body

It adapts and optimizes itself to save host's body:

>The parasites become more energy efficient so the Haven organ is less taxing on the infected host, letting it live longer.


>It begins to understand and use magic to create defenses from healthy hosts, to keep them from killing infected hosts

However,

>infected hosts would often implode in gory, luminescent magic, [which] actually was used [as an] advantage, [being] [a] viable infective method.

## Host Integration

As mentioned before,

>When it attaches to the brain stem the host begins to lose conscious thought, [being] no longer able to think for themselves.

The parasite controls its victims by

>release[ing] its own signals and hormones [to] the brain to [provide] motor control.

Unfortunately,

>the host would die due to certain organs not receiving the right signals from the brain.

Following "death",

>the parasite begins to understand bodily function and makes less careless mistakes so the host can live. [It] begins to use signals [to] create stronger muscle tissue through its own stimulus. It also creates bigger and better organs through said stimulus. The host anatomy becomes unrecognizable as the bone structure, organs, and tissue change to suit the parasites’ will.

## Appearance

>The parasite glows, [is] very, very small, and actually looks cute. [It is] often first mistaken as harmless.

>They also can shape shift to not look like the Haven parasite. [For example, they can shape shift to look exactly] like a bag of tea.

## Immunity

>Dragons are immune but the Havins have evolved over time to be able to combat them.

It has not been specified whether other races can be/are immunized.

# The Denis Elliot Device

>Sometimes in certain areas this parasite would appear. They were known as the “Haven Outbreaks”. But due to advancement in technology and centralization, the parasite slowly disappeared and was declared to be eradicated.

>The parasite was weak[,] and if anyone could fight an infected host without the parasites attaching to a new healthy host[,] it could be eliminated as the parasite(s) were starved out.

Current technology and the world conflict had other plans in store, though.

>The Greater War several years in proves to be a brutal conflict. No quarter, no mercy. In a desperate attempt to quickly end the war an empire develops a magical/biological weapon. The Denis Elliot Device or DED for short made by one of the greatest scientists led by moral belief that this evil is for the greater good.

>The DED is a containment device for the Haven parasite that keeps it alive until it is unleashed. A similar[,] greater containment device was used to engineer and test it in a safe environment. It is similar to our world's nuclear warhead, but carries a virus instead of highly reactive atoms.

>It contains a parasite that was thought to be eradicated long ago[,] and for good reason. 

>It had magic[al properties] that was[/were] unexplained by science.

>Denis Elliot made the parasite more dangerous so it could be quick and swift. So much so that the parasite would accidently kill itself after just a few hours. It also had a quick breeding rate so it could spread fast. He chose this disease for its infectiousness and deadliness. However[,] this genetically engineered and unknowingly magically engineered plague would prove its unpredictability.

## Purpose

>The DED would be used against military installations and even on the front lines. After it was used the troops could move in after the Haven took its effect. But the empire’s military quickly changed their targets to civilians to diminish the enemy's morale and productivity. To a certain extent, [this tactic] proved to be working and the empire made quick advances across [enemy] territories.

## Effect

>The Haven has survived its kill switch. Now the world is on the verge of collapse. Current surviving governments [have] put up a resistance against Haven on an allied front. [The Greater War] finally turned into a stalemate as the Qoryntinians fought against the evolution curve of Haven. [The Haven] has started to build a bigger [consciousness] of greater intelligence and survives indefinitely. The infected hosts are [feared, and] called "Havins". To the current day[,] the amount of mutations are almost lost track of and every foe a Qoryntinian face is an unpredictable one.
